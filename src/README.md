# vrlin
um I guess more like a theremin but idk the right hand feels more like using a bow, and VRLin sounds better than VReremin.

This turns some input from your VR controllers into midi output, sent to the midi device of your choice.

So what I did was I installed [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html), which just takes whatever midi output it's given, and sends it as input, I choose to send the midi output from the VRLin to this loopback midi, and in a program like fl studio, I enable the loopback midi device's input ONLY (not output. That'll cause feedback).

Pressing anything on your right controller playes a note.<br>
Releasing what you pressed releases the note ü§Ø

The velocity on the x axis (I think lol. One of the axises) of the right controller, while a button on the right controller is pressed, controls midi controller #16. You press a button on the right controller and wave it around and it'll change that controller based on the speed in um a direction. Idk I just try to find whatever direction affects the midi output the most, or find the direction that doesn't affect it and go perpendicular to that

The height of the left controller, while a button on the left controller is pressed, controlls midi controller #17. You link this to a pitch bend, and the other one to a volume, and you get a theremin kind of thing üëç
